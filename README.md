# FreeSyn
Application independent sample free population synthesis framework

This is a heuristic method for synthesising agent populations using survey data. This was partially funded by Life Time Affordable and Tennable City Housing (LATCH) project (https://rmit-tst4.aws.rmit.edu.au/research/research-institutes-centres-and-groups/research-centres/centre-for-urban-research/projects/current-projects/lifetime-affordable-and-tenable-city-housing/about).

Instructions on how to set up and execute will be made available soon.
